### 26.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

​	去除重复元素，每个元素只出现一次，要求不增加新的数组空间实现，且新数组后面的部分不影响  返回值为新数组的长度 

思路：采用两指针，一个指针i指向原数组需要判断的元素，一个指针j指向新数组新加入的元素。  由于是有序数组，因此只要判断原数组中的元素不同于新数组新加入的元素，就将原数组的元素和新数组后一元素交换位置即可，没有重复元素就是和自身交换位置。 

````python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            #比较当前元素和前一个元素，不同加入数组，相同跳过
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[j+1] = nums[i]    #注意这里是j+1不是j
                j += 1
        return j + 1
