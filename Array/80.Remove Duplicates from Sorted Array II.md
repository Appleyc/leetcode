### 80.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II 

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

​	这道题跟Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array比较类似，区别只是这里元素可以重复出现至多两次，而不是一次。其实也比较简单，只需要维护一个count，当count是2时，就直接跳过即可，否则说明元素出现次数没有超，继续放入结果数组，若遇到新元素则重置count。总体算法只需要扫描一次数组，所以时间上是O(n)，空间上只需要维护一个count , j ,和tmp ，所以是O(1)

````python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        count = 1
        j = 0
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            #比较当前元素和前一个元素，不同加入数组，相同跳过     
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                nums[j+1] = nums[i]
                count = 1
            if count < 3:
                j += 1
            tmp = nums[i]
            nums[i] = nums[j]
            nums[j] = tmp
        return j+1
